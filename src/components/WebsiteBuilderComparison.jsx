                      Since consumers today expect virtually every business to
                      have an easily accessible website, website builders are
                      valuable assets for teams with minimal tech skills.
                      Instead of enlisting the pricey services of a design
                      agency or a web developer, companies in virtually any
                      industry can use a web builder to launch the professional
                      site their business needs.

                      A website builder platform works by providing the user
                      tools to build their own website. These tools are
                      typically available through a web browser. Once you’re
                      logged in, you’ll choose a template for your site, also
                      known as a theme. These themes are usually customizable
                      and allow you to incorporate your company’s branding, from
                      your logo to your preferred color scheme and typography.
                      There will be various elements for you to fill in or add
                      to your homepage, as well as any additional pages you
                      create for a richer customer experience. Thanks to
                      drag-and-drop tools, programming knowledge isn’t usually
                      necessary. A simple text editor will help you add content,
                      and your chosen builder may even have an AI-powered
                      function that creates the content for you.
                    </p>

                      During the design process, you’ll have the opportunity to
                      add an “About Us” page, services or products page,
                      e-commerce store, contact page and anything else you want.
                      You can also take advantage of integrations with online
                      payment platforms, social media sites and cybersecurity
                      protections. To make it even easier, some programs have
                      “wizards” that walk you through the site creation process
                      step by step.

                      With your new business website, you can accomplish any
                      number of goals. For example, a site with a lead capture
                      form can get potential new clients into your pipeline. One
                      with an online store and strong calls to action can boost
                      conversions and revenue. If your website includes a chat
                      function, you can provide instantaneous customer service.
                      Your site design can even help your business rank higher
                      in Google search results. It’s up to you to decide your
                      website’s purpose; a website builder is what helps you
                      achieve those objectives. [Learn about the website design

                      Most no-code website builders offer free personal plans,
                      free trials and tiered subscriptions that increase in
                      price and functionality with each level. Subscriptions are
                      charged monthly and often discounted if you pay annually.

                      Most entry-level subscriptions cost around $10 per month
                      per site, while intermediate subscriptions tend to be in
                      the $15-$20 monthly range. Higher-end, drag-and-drop
                      design packages, which often include more customization
                      options and better analytics, usually cost around $25 to
                      $40 per month and can increase into the hundreds for
                      specialty platforms geared toward large enterprises. Keep
                      in mind that a plan with e-commerce capabilities typically
                      costs more than one without.

                      You should also take into account the cost of securing a
                      website domain and hosting for your site. The best website
                      builders also facilitate domain registration and hosting.
                      Some providers will grant you a free domain for one year,
                      but otherwise, this is typically an annual cost of about
                      $10 to $20. Hosting may cost anywhere from a few dollars a
                      month to upward of $100 per month, depending on the type
                      of web host. You may also have to pay for an SSL
                      certificate, which authenticates your website and allows
                      encryption; this can cost around $60 a year but increase
                      to more than $1,000, depending on the circumstances.
                      Additional expenses you may incur include fees for
                      integrations, cybersecurity and dedicated support.

                      When choosing a website builder, you should begin with a
                      few essential questions: What goals am I trying to
                      accomplish with my website? What features and tools do I
                      need to achieve those objectives? How much can I afford to
                      spend? The answers to those questions can help you narrow
                      down the options. In fact, you can use guides like this
                      one to see which platforms line up with your preferences
                      and budget.

                      "Budgeting and funds can be tight when you're just getting

                      dollars," said Jason Anthony of the Jason Anthony Group.
                      "Sometimes when this happens, changes have to be made down
                      the line and more development and design costs are accrued
                      from having to rebuild or rework your project. Getting it

                      "My most important criteria were the customization options
                      and no platform or vendor lock-in," said Derek Hassan,
                      owner of Five Lights Web Design. "I greatly value the
                      ability to change or customize the website as I see fit,
                      and the freedom to change web hosting companies if

                      Ilgenfritz also kept "flexibility and functionality" top
                      of mind when deciding which website builder to use. "You
                      want to make sure that your tech stack doesn't preclude
                      you from making ... changes," he said. "If you need to add
                      some plugins or custom code in at a later date, you want
                      the ability to do so. Some platforms are very closed off
                      and make it incredibly difficult to do anything custom."

                      JD Lloyd, business development manager at Bella Virtual

                      "We prioritized ease of use and design flexibility above

                      website had to look top-notch and be easy to navigate. We
                      also considered the cost, but in the end, we were more
                      focused on finding a tool that allowed us to build a site

                      In addition to evaluating website builders'

                      "People need to choose a platform that coincides with

                      people "aren't comfortable with some basic concepts around
                      HTML or CSS," while others "want more control to do custom

                      recommended, "Choose something you understand and that you

                      Madjeen Lorthe, founder of Transitions Well Done, chose a

                      as she didn't want to "rely on a developer or handle

                      "I was looking for a platform that could scale with my

                      available and stability," Kyslik said. "In a perfect

                      through the first few years of my business, [but] I really
                      wanted to avoid having to switch solutions every year or
                      more, as it takes so much time and that time could be

                      Indeed, Lloyd admitted, "If I could go back, I might have
                      spent a bit more time exploring options that offer greater
                      scalability." While "pretty satisfied" with his website
                      builder, he's since found "some limitations" as Bella
                      Virtual Staging's needs have changed, and his company
                      might made a different purchase decision had they "known

                      "Think about where you want your business to be in a few
                      years, not just where it is now," Lloyd recommended. "Your
                      website should be able to grow with you. So, look beyond
                      just getting a site live quickly — consider how easily you
                      can add new features, integrate with other tools and
                      expand your site's capabilities as your business needs
                      evolve. It's better to plan for growth from the start than
                      to have to make a major switch down the line."

                      support, as we needed a platform that could handle large

                      heavily on accessing e-books, webinars and articles, so

                      Looking back though, Pappas regrets not also diving deeper
                      into different content management systems "to ensure
                      smoother scaling as our content grew rapidly." Now, he
                      advised, "For content-heavy [businesses], prioritize

                      Your website builder should be easy to use, whether you
                      want to update your current website or build a new site
                      from scratch. The best platforms have demos and setup
                      wizards that show you how to make a website quickly and
                      effectively. Most of the solutions we analyzed have a
                      variety of website templates and design tools. Web
                      templates should be highly customizable and responsive to
                      desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Drag-and-drop
                      capabilities make it easy to shift elements such as images
                      or widgets. HTML or CSS editors are also helpful
                      inclusions because this means the software serves
                      experienced web designers as well as novices.

                      Since roughly half of website traffic comes from mobile

                      accommodate those users. Many search engine algorithms

                      Besides offering web design solutions, the best website
                      builders also host your site. Most programs offer free
                      custom domain hosting for at least the first year of your
                      subscription. While this feature is touted as free, you
                      typically have to pay for setup fees or register your
                      domain privately. Each website creation application comes
                      with a basic hosting plan that is essential to giving your
                      site a professional domain. However, if unlimited storage

                      Online shopping is on the rise, making e-commerce
                      functionality a valuable feature to look for in a website
                      builder. Even if you don't currently want to sell any
                      products online, it's important to find a service that can
                      scale with your business (in case you want to sell online
                      in the future, for example). Some platforms limit the
                      number of items you can sell, so if this is a core element
                      of your company, it could be a make-or-break factor.

                      Storage is another vital feature to consider, especially

                      e-commerce store, consider plans that allow for a higher
                      number of products or pages. If you intend to create more

                      To determine the best website builders, our team of
                      technology experts and software analysts evaluated an
                      initial list of 50 platforms, with some design agencies
                      mixed in. We sought to determine whether business owners
                      would find more value with a DIY solution or a
                      full-service design company. This comparison helped narrow
                      our list to eight options.

                    <p>
                      To choose our five top recommendations, we analyzed each
                      solution's rates and contracts, industries served, web
                      hosting and storage capabilities, design options and other
                      aspects. We tested the builders ourselves, researched
                      Better Business Bureau ratings and accreditations, and
                      also took into account customer reviews and testimonials.

                    <p>
                      In the end, our experts and analysts studied each website
                      builder's functionality and judged the programs on more
                      than 30 factors. These factors were broken down into
                      categories and weighted differently in our overall
                      conclusion. The weights were determined based on how much
                      business owners prioritize these criteria when shopping
                      for business software and services and making purchasing
                      decisions.

                        user-friendliness and customization options. We also

                        package tiers. We also examined each vendor's online

                      Based on these criteria, we not only determined which
                      website builders our readers could trust but also the ways
                      in which each solution could best serve different business
                      needs. Some services were better at certain tasks than
                      others or more suited to a particular type of company.
